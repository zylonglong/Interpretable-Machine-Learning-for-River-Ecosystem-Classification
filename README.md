 Interpretable Machine Learning for River Ecosystem Classification
This repository contains model training code and SHAP-based interpretability results for three ecological classification tasks using XGBoost:

River Habitat Types

River Formation Classes

Non-native Fish Invasion Gradient

ðŸ“˜ Description
This project supports the explainable machine learning components of a freshwater ecological modeling study. The models were developed using XGBoost and CatBoost, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was applied to quantify the feature contributions across samples and tasks.
The interactive HTML files allow detailed, sample-specific exploration of SHAP values and enhance the transparency of model decisions.

These materials are referenced in the main manuscript and supplementary materials (e.g., Supplementary Data S1â€“S3).
